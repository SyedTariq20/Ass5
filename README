The main aim of the program is to manage resources and allocate them to processes, avoiding deadlock. 
When ever a resource is being allocated to a process after it request for it, a deadlock avoidance executes to verify for a safe state. If it's true then allocate the request.
When it is an unsafe state it creates a queue and block the process. It unblocks the resource when the resource is released and run the deadlock avoidance algorithm and verify it works according to the request.
